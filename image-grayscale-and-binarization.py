Description:
This script performs fundamental image processing tasks as a demonstration of
manual, pixel-by-pixel manipulation. It downloads an image from a URL,
converts it to grayscale using the luminosity method, and then binarizes it
based on a set threshold.

The core image processing logic is implemented "from scratch" using standard
Python loops and data structures, intentionally avoiding high-level functions
from libraries like OpenCV or Scikit-Image for the processing steps.
The Pillow (PIL) library is used only for the essential tasks of loading the
initial image from a byte stream and saving the resulting processed images.

How to run:
1. Ensure you have the necessary libraries: pip install Pillow requests
2. Execute the script from your terminal: python image_processor.py

# os.path.basename gets the last part of the URL (the filename)
filename_with_ext = os.path.basename(url)
